<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
Give a concise description of current problem. For instance, what
needs to be solved and why it is useful?  Do you make any assumptions?
What are the difficulties?
The purpose of this assignment was to impement a logistic regression classifier and a neural network class in Python that can receive input respresenting images of numbers and process them successfully.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might describe the motivation of current idea, the algorithmic steps or any formulation used in current method.
For this progamming assignment, I mostly referred to the code and pseudo-code used in lab and built off of it when necessary. For my logisitic regression classifier, I implemented the functions
  <ul>
    <li>init: Initializes the parameters needed for the logistic regression classifier
    <li>compute_cost: Computes the average cost of the data set inputted
    <li>predict: Makes a prediction based on the data set inputted
    <li>fit: Learns parameters to fit the data set inputted
  </ul>
The functions for the Neural Network were adapted off of the logistic regression classifier
</p>

<p>
Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out your algorithmic steps described above.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>
Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you
performed, and the relevant parameter values.  </p>
<p>
Define your evaluation
metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time. </p>


<hr>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
List your experimental results.  Provide examples of input images and output
images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps
Question 1: implemented
Question 2: implemented
Can your logistic regression classifier learn non-linear decision boundaries? Why or why not?
No because the output of the classifier is determined by a linear function
Question 3: implemented
Can your neural network model (with one hidden layer) learn non-linear decision boundaries? Why or why not?
Yes because the output of the classifier is determined by a nonlinear function
Question 4: implemented
What effect does learning rate have on how your neural network is trained? Illustrate your answer by training your model using different learning rates. Provide plots illustrating the total cost of your model over time for different settings of the learning rate.
When the learning rate of the neural network increases, the accuracy will decline, as shown in problem4.png
Question 5: implemented 
What effect does the number of nodes in the hidden layer have on how your neural network is trained? Illustrate your answer by training your model using different numbers of hidden layer nodes. Provide plots showing the decision boundaries learned by your model for different settings of the number of nodes in the hidden layer.
When the number of nodes in the hidden layer is increased, the neural network's accuracy will improve, as shown in problem5.png
Question 6: implemented

Question 7: implemented

<hr>
<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
<ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
main message?
Based on looking back at my own work, I am mostly satisfied with the functions I have implemented. Overall, I have learned how linear regression classifiers and neural networks work and if anything else I have learned that I need to polish my html skills to make my reports look nicer.
</p>

<h2> Credits and Bibliography </h2>
<p>

Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing
your solution.  Citations to papers should include the authors, the
year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication
information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and
location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and
institution).  Material on the web should include the url and date of
access.
</p>

<p>
Credit any joint work or discussions with your classmates.
